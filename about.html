            <h2>Who we are</h2>
        
            <p>The Zephaniah Owidi Odong(ZOO) Memorial Foundation is inspired by the life of The Late Zephaniah 
            Owidi Odongo who:</p>

            <p>

              <ul>
                <li>Grew up in extreme poverty in rural Kenya.</li>
                <li>Through education, dedication and the good will of others in supporting his determination,
                overcame <em>serious adversity</em>, excelled in his scholarship.</li>
                <li>Became a distinguished Electrical Engineer <em>who contributed significantly to the Kenyan Telecom
                industry</em> and perfomed activities supported by this organization.</li>
                <li>Believed and demonstrated that <em>education really is the key out of poverty</em>, and that 
                <em>technology</em> bridges the world.</li>
              </ul>
            
            </p>

            <h2>What we do</h2>

            <p>We:</p>

            <p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Set up ICT centers &ndash; Beneficiaries of The ZOO Memorial Foundation have fully functional ICT 
                centers with donated computers and internet connection.</li>
                <li>Training &ndash; The foundation provides and facilitates computer literacy training to its beneficiary center trainers and members of the community.</li>
                <li>Creating awareness &ndash; Societies around beneficiary centers are encouraged and enabled to 
                take part in ICT activities such as using message boards, chat rooms and email.</li>

            <h2>Why ICT centers?</h2>
            
            <p>A number of converging trends make our foundation's Rural ICT Project relevant in ICT facilitation
            and accessibility especially in rural Kenya.</p>

            <p>

              <ul>
                <li>Increased use of ICT for both economic and social development.</li>
                <li>Growth of mobile telephony and mobile service providers.</li>
                <li>Increased necessity for use of ICT and limited skilled persons.</li>
                <li>Limited or no ICT access to majority of rural Kenya.</li>
                <li>Technology shy &ndash; we see this as an opportunity to make changes within an evolving industry.</li>
              </ul>
